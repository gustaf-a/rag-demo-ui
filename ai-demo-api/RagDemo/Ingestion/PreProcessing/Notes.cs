    /// When building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application, preprocessing your data effectively is crucial for accurate indexing and retrieval. Different file types often require specialized preprocessing to extract meaningful information. Here's a breakdown of preprocessing steps you could apply for various file types:

    //1. Text Files(.txt)
    //Encoding Detection: Ensure correct text encoding(UTF-8, ASCII, etc.).
    //Text Normalization: Convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation and extra whitespace.
    //Tokenization: Split text into words or sentences.
    //Stopword Removal: Remove common words that may not add value (e.g., "the", "and").
    //Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
    //Chunking: Divide large texts into smaller, manageable sections for indexing.
    //2. PDF Documents(.pdf)
    //Text Extraction: Use libraries like iTextSharp or PDFBox to extract text.
    //OCR Processing: Apply Optical Character Recognition if the PDF contains scanned images of text.
    //Layout Preservation: Maintain headings and bullet points for context.
    //Image Extraction: If relevant, extract images and preprocess them separately.
    //3. Word Documents(.docx)
    //Content Extraction: Utilize OpenXML SDK or NPOI to read text and formatting.
    //Metadata Retrieval: Extract author, title, and other document properties.
    //Embedded Objects Handling: Process embedded images, tables, and charts if necessary.
    //Style Stripping: Remove styling tags unless formatting is important for context.
    //4. Excel Spreadsheets (.xlsx)
    //Data Parsing: Read cells, rows, and columns using libraries like EPPlus.
    //Header Identification: Detect and process header rows for context.
    //Data Normalization: Convert numerical data into text summaries if needed.
    //Formula Evaluation: Decide whether to evaluate formulas or extract them as is.
    //5. CSV Files (.csv)
    //Delimiter Handling: Ensure correct handling of commas, semicolons, or tabs.
    //Data Cleaning: Remove or correct malformed entries.
    //Type Conversion: Convert data types where necessary (e.g., strings to dates).
    //Structured Data Transformation: Map data into key-value pairs or objects.
    //6. HTML Files (.html)
    //HTML Parsing: Use HTML Agility Pack to parse and navigate the DOM.
    //    Tag Stripping: Remove HTML tags to extract text content.
    //Script and Style Removal: Exclude<script> and <style> contents.
    //Hyperlink Extraction: Optionally extract URLs for link analysis.
    //7. JSON Files (.json)
    //Parsing: Use System.Text.Json or Newtonsoft.Json to parse the JSON structure.
    //Flattening Nested Structures: Convert nested objects into flat structures if required.
    //Key-Value Extraction: Extract and index relevant fields.
    //Schema Validation: Ensure the JSON adheres to expected schemas.
    //8. Images (.jpg, .png, etc.)
    //OCR Processing: Apply OCR to extract any embedded text.
    //Metadata Extraction: Read EXIF data for additional context.
    //Image Recognition: Use computer vision to identify objects or scenes if relevant.
    //9. Audio Files (.mp3, .wav)
    //Speech-to-Text Transcription: Convert audio content to text using services like Azure Speech Services.
    //Silence Removal: Eliminate silent parts to optimize transcription.
    //Language Detection: Identify the language spoken for proper processing.
    //10. Video Files (.mp4, .avi)
    //Audio Extraction: Isolate the audio track for transcription.
    //Frame Sampling: Extract key frames for image analysis.
    //Subtitle Processing: If available, process subtitle files for text content.
    //Scene Detection: Segment the video into scenes for contextual indexing.
    //11. XML Files (.xml)
    //Parsing: Use XML readers to parse the structure.
    //Namespace Handling: Manage XML namespaces appropriately.
    //Data Extraction: Extract text content and attribute values.
    //Schema Validation: Validate against XSD if schemas are defined.
    //12. Compressed Files (.zip, .tar)
    //Decompression: Extract files using appropriate libraries.
    //    Recursive Processing: Apply preprocessing to each extracted file based on its type.
    //Integrity Checking: Verify that files are not corrupted during extraction.
    //General Preprocessing Steps
    //Language Detection: Identify the language to apply language-specific processing.
    //Encoding Normalization: Standardize text encoding to UTF-8.
    //Error Handling: Implement robust exception handling for unreadable or corrupted files.
    //Logging: Keep logs of preprocessing steps for auditing and debugging.
    //Implementation Tips
    //Factory Pattern Usage: Implement a factory that returns the appropriate preprocessor based on file extension or content type.
    //Parallel Processing: Use asynchronous programming to process multiple files concurrently.
    //Configuration: Make preprocessing steps configurable to easily enable or disable certain actions.
    //Scalability Considerations: Optimize for large files or datasets by streaming data instead of loading it entirely into memory.
