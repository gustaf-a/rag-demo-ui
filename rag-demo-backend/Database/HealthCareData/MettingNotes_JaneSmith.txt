Meeting Notes

We discussed one of our patients today, a woman in her early 30s dealing with hypothyroidism and migraines.

Thyroid Management: Her levothyroxine dosage was recently increased from 50mcg to 75mcg due to borderline high TSH levels. Latest labs show improvement, but we'll keep monitoring. Next follow-up is in three months.

Migraine Treatment: She was having migraines 2-3 times a month. After prescribing a stronger dose of ibuprofen and recommending lifestyle changes, she's down to about one migraine a month. If this continues, we might consider preventive therapy.

Recent Vaccinations: She received her annual flu shot and a Tdap booster with no adverse reactions. Reminded her to keep up with the vaccination schedule.

Overall, she's in good health. We'll continue to monitor her thyroid levels and migraines.
